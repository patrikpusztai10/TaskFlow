# TaskFlow

This app is a task manager which can be used by three types of users: admins, employees and teamleaders.   
For the GUI I used JavaFX and for the data base MySQL was used through a JDBC driver.  
Description of the features:  
1)Admins are in charge with maintaining the security of the application. If a user enters wrong credentials multiple times  
or some errors occured , all can be viewed by admins.  
2)Teamleaders can enter tasks for employees, view all the completed tasks for a workday and view performance related  
statistics of the employees.  
3)Employees can view and complete their tasks, view their performance, and they can also have access the a feature  
called sessions which allows them to keep track of the time spent working on a specific task.
